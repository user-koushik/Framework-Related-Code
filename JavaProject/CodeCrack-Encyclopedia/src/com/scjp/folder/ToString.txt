Override toString() when you want a mere mortal to be able to read something meaningful about the objects of your class.
Code can call toString() on your object when it wants to read useful details about your object.When you pass an object reference to the System.out.println() method, for
example, the object's toString() method is called, and the return of toString().

Without overriding the toString() method:

o/p : HardToRead@a47e0

Overriding toString() method:

public String toString() {
return ("I am a Bob, but you can call me " + nickName + ". My shoe size is " + shoeSize);
} 

o/p: I am Bob but you can call me Bob Dylan.  My shoe size is 8.
